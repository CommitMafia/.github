## 🚩 What is CommitMafia?

**CommitMafia** is a collective workspace for personal projects, freelance deliveries, and small but useful tools. It is where prototypes grow into products and ideas are tested in the open.

We work across:
- ⚡️ **Micro SaaS experiments** that scratch our own itch
- 🛠️ **Web3 utilities** (contracts, SDKs, bots)
- 🧩 **Freelance delivery repositories**
- 🗂️ **Templates, CLIs, and developer utilities**
- 🧪 **Weekend research and builds**

We believe in *iterative building*, clean code, and learning through shipping.
